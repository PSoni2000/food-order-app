# NOTES

<ol>
<li>

**.bind(null,argument)**

<p>

```
onRemove={cartItemRemoveHandler.bind(null, item.id)}
onAdd={cartItemAddHandler.bind(null, item)}
```

bind pre-configure a function for future execution and basically allows you to pre-configure the argument.
that function will receive when it's being executed.
and thats something we need to insure that both these function do receive

</li>
</ol>
